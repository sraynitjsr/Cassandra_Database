## What is Cassandra?

#### Cassandra is a distributed NoSQL database system that was originally developed by Facebook and later open-sourced as an Apache project.
#### It is designed to handle large amounts of data spread out across many commodity servers while providing high availability and fault tolerance.
#### Cassandra is optimized for write-heavy workloads and offers linear scalability by adding more nodes to the cluster.

## Key Concepts:-

#### a. Nodes: Cassandra is a distributed database, and data is distributed across multiple nodes. Each node can serve read and write requests independently.

#### b. Clusters: A Cassandra cluster is a group of nodes that work together. Data is replicated across multiple nodes in the cluster for fault tolerance.

#### c. Keyspaces: Keyspaces are the top-level containers for data in Cassandra, similar to databases in traditional relational databases. Each keyspace contains multiple tables.

#### d. Tables: Tables in Cassandra are similar to tables in relational databases but have a more flexible schema. Each table has a primary key, which uniquely identifies rows in the table.

#### e. Partitioning: Cassandra distributes data across multiple nodes using partitioning. Each row in a table is identified by a partition key, and Cassandra uses a partitioner to determine which node in the cluster should store the data based on the partition key.

#### f. Replication: Cassandra replicates data across multiple nodes in the cluster to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. We can configure the replication strategy and the number of replicas for each keyspace.

#### g. Consistency Levels: Cassandra offers tunable consistency levels, allowing us to trade off consistency for availability and performance. Consistency levels determine how many replicas must respond to a read or write operation for it to be considered successful.

## Basic Operations:

#### a. Inserting Data: To insert data into Cassandra, we use the INSERT statement. Data is written to the appropriate node based on the partition key.

#### b. Querying Data: We can query data from Cassandra using the SELECT statement. Queries are routed to the appropriate nodes based on the partition key.

#### c. Updating and Deleting Data: Cassandra supports updating and deleting data using the UPDATE and DELETE statements, respectively.

#### d. Creating and Managing Tables: We can create and manage tables using the CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements. Tables can have composite primary keys and secondary indexes.

## Consistency Levels:

#### Cassandra offers various consistency levels for read and write operations, including ONE, QUORUM, LOCAL_QUORUM, ALL, etc. These levels allow us to control the trade-off between consistency, availability, and performance.

## Data Modeling:

#### Data modeling in Cassandra involves denormalizing data to optimize for query performance. We typically model our data based on our query patterns rather than normalizing it.

## Scaling:

#### Cassandra is designed to scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster. As our data grows, we can add more nodes to handle the increased load.
